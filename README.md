I wired up a b10k slide potentiometer, an ec11b rotary encoder, a 128x32 oled, a single ws2811b led and some buttons to a pro micro and used it to control things on my computer.

##### Software used for extra functionality:
AIMP (music control)  
SoundSwitch (source control)  
Medibang (zoom, rotate)
